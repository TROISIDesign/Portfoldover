                        I started consulting at the perfect time - when the
                        world wasnâ€™t completely falling apart. Video exploded,
                        and my 15+ years in the space allowed me to actually
                        help people who's projects were on fire. I know how to
                        deliver, and I guarantee satisfaction to a reasonable
                        extent. Ask me what that's about!

                        I have an incredible sense of humour and my secondary
                        goal besides profit and performance is fun and laughter.
                        If people are laughing it's a guarantee they are
                        grinding much more than quiet and reserved. If you hire
                        me and you don't laugh then I will work my ass off to
                        turn you around.

                        Seriously, "consulting" is for Bain and McK and all
                        those people who LBO a company, completely gut it to
                        death while borrowing against the assets and lining
                        their pockets, then bankrupting it and walking away like
                        that's an accomplishment. I charge what I need to house
                        and feed my family and the rest is all just icing. It's
                        fun.

                        If we sign a contract, whether for a day, a week, or,
                        let's stick to weekly; I am 100% focused and attuned to
                        you and your company for my entire working hours,
                        including availability off hours and
                        strategy/homework/prepwork when not face to face. Also,
                        I am happy to attend in person or remote, whichever
                        works better for you. Double-vaxxed double-boosted and I
                        take health seriously. But remote is great practice for
                        Async strategy.
